           <p>This is a painting of a landscape. Cattle are presented in a natural habitat surrounded by trees, plants and water. The landscape also shows the sky and clouds which is half of the painting meanwhile the other half is of the ground and trees. The cattle are walking toward the water. Water is a very important element in nature because all living things need water to survive. The painting shows a sun rise or the day setting because the top half of the sky is darker then the centre which is covered with a yellow undertone, indicating the light of the sun. The trees are green, scattered around the landscape, and the ground is covered in dirt and scrubs. This painting is a representation of linear perspective. If you look at the cattle the first one drinking from the water is larger then the others following him. As well as the trees, the ones in the foreground are larger than those in the back. The clouds also look as if they are in the distant high skies.</p>
